# Contacts
☎️Contacts lets humans create contact cards, so that they can talk to other humans without being confused.

So, someone needs your digits? No problem, couldn't be easier. Observe:

```python
from contacts import ContactCard

card = ContactCard(
    name='David Heimann',
    first_name='David',
    last_name='Heimann',
    phone_number='+1XXXXXXX',
    photo=image_file,
    email='email@address.com',
    twitter='@david_heimann',
    website='https://about.me/dheimann'
)

# Build the card to generate a file that can be saved locally or to a server of your choosing.
card.build()
```

**⚠️WARNING⚠️:** Contacts is a WIP and doesn't work yet. Feel free to help out or subscribe / star and follow 
along. I'll remove this when it's usable.
